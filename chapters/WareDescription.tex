\section{Calibration experiments}

The first task that I needed to complete at the beginning of my thesis work was the calibration of at least a line of the superconducting quibts of chip \tt{qw11q} using the \tt{Qibocal} library.
In the following I will describe the experiments that I performed and commenting on the results.
